<use_case>
Use this resource to retrieve comprehensive details about a specific RDS database instance
identified by its instance ID. This provides deeper insights than the instance list resource.
</use_case>

<important_notes>
1. The instance ID must exist in your AWS account and region
2. The response contains full configuration details about the specified instance
3. This resource includes information not available in the list view such as storage details,
   parameter groups, backup configuration, and maintenance windows
4. Use the instance list resource first to identify valid instance IDs
5. Error responses will be returned if the instance doesn't exist or there are permission issues
</important_notes>

## Response structure
Returns a JSON document containing detailed instance information including:
- `instance_id`: The unique identifier for the instance
- `status`: Current status of the instance
- `engine`: Database engine type
- `engine_version`: The version of the database engine
- `endpoint`: Connection endpoint information including address, port and hosted zone
- `instance_class`: The compute and memory capacity of the instance
- `availability_zone`: The AZ where the instance is located
- `multi_az`: Whether the instance is a Multi-AZ deployment
- `storage`: Detailed storage configuration including type, allocation and encryption status
- `preferred_backup_window`: When automated backups occur
- `preferred_maintenance_window`: When maintenance operations can occur
- `publicly_accessible`: Whether the instance is publicly accessible
- `vpc_security_groups`: Security groups associated with the instance
- `db_cluster`: The DB cluster identifier if this instance is part of a cluster
- `tags`: Any tags associated with the instance
- `resource_uri`: The full resource URI for this specific instance
