<use_case>
Use this resource to retrieve comprehensive details about a specific RDS database cluster
identified by its cluster ID. This provides deeper insights than the cluster list resource.
</use_case>

<important_notes>
1. The cluster ID must exist in your AWS account and region
2. The response contains full configuration details about the specified cluster
3. This resource includes information not available in the list view such as parameter groups,
   backup configuration, and maintenance windows
4. Use the cluster list resource first to identify valid cluster IDs
5. Error responses will be returned if the cluster doesn't exist or there are permission issues
</important_notes>

## Response structure
Returns a JSON document containing detailed cluster information:
- All fields from the list view plus:
- `endpoint`: The primary endpoint for connecting to the cluster
- `reader_endpoint`: The reader endpoint for read operations (if applicable)
- `port`: The port the database engine is listening on
- `parameter_group`: Database parameter group information
- `backup_retention_period`: How long backups are retained (in days)
- `preferred_backup_window`: When automated backups occur
- `preferred_maintenance_window`: When maintenance operations can occur
- `resource_uri`: The full resource URI for this specific cluster
