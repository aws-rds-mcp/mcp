<use_case>
Use this resource to retrieve comprehensive details about a specific RDS database cluster
identified by its cluster ID. This is particularly useful for monitoring the status,
configuration, and connectivity options of an individual cluster.
</use_case>

<important_notes>
1. The cluster ID must exist in your AWS account and region
2. The response contains full configuration details about the specified cluster
3. Error responses will be returned if the cluster doesn't exist or you lack permissions
4. The information returned includes backup and maintenance windows useful for operational planning
5. Security group information can be used to verify network configurations
</important_notes>

## Response structure
Returns a JSON document containing detailed cluster information including:
- Status, engine type, and version
- Writer and reader endpoints for connection
- Multi-AZ deployment status
- Backup configuration and retention periods
- Maintenance windows
- Creation timestamp
- Member instances with their roles (writer/reader)
- Security groups configuration
- Associated tags
