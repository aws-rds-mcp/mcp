# Amazon RDS Control Plane MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for accessing Amazon RDS and Aurora database information. This server provides tools and resources for viewing database clusters, instances, configurations, and monitoring through a standardized interface.

## Overview

The RDS Control Plane MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol to provide read-only access to RDS resources:

- **View detailed information** about RDS DB instances and clusters
- **Access connection endpoints, configuration, and status information**
- **List performance reports and log files** for DB instances
- **Safe access** through read-only mode by default

## How MCP Works

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for communication between AI assistants and external tools/resources. This server implements MCP to:

1. **Expose Resources**: Read-only data sources (like listing all databases)
2. **Handle Requests**: Process incoming requests from MCP clients
3. **Return Responses**: Send structured responses back to clients

## Available Resources

Resources provide read-only access to RDS data:

- **DB Instances**: View details about database instances
- **DB Clusters**: View details about database clusters
- **Connection Information**: Access endpoints for connecting to databases
- **Configuration Details**: View database settings and configurations
- **Status Information**: Check the current state of database resources
- **Performance Data**: Access performance reports and metrics
- **Log Files**: View log data for troubleshooting

## Safety Features

### Read-Only Mode
The server operates in read-only mode by default, providing safe access to RDS resources without the risk of making changes to the database environment.
